# Why Should You Use It?
You should use xonncz reborn because our gorilla tag mod menu creats an admissive modding experience. Xonncz Reborn also has many features that some menus don't, for example we have an Inviz On Touch. Inviz On Touch is not included on most Gorilla Tag Mod Menu, but on our gorilla tag mod menu it is. It makes it so that when a gorilla touches your head you go invisable. And Another example we have is Ghost On Touch. It is pretty much the same thing as inviz on touch, but when a gorilla touches your head you go into a ghost. Another reason you should use our mod menu is because it allows users to customize their menu to the maximum.
# Is It A Rat / Malware / Trojan / Virus / whatever the fuck you want to call it!
Nope! Idfc what you say its open source you can look for yourself ðŸ˜Š
